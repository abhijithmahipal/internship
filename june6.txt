Read and worked out git1.pdf along with gitbasic.mp4

Created branch, added files, watched log reports, merged branch, and finally deleted branch.
Have to use -D if not merged. then the data will lose as well. 

Watched github/*.mp4
Added SSH key to my account.
Had earlier created repository and studied to commit and push. 
Thats all for the day.
